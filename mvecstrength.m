function [vs,pvs] = mvecstrength(tspx,T)
% function [vs,pvs] = mvecstrength(tspx,T)
% 
% This function computes the so-called vector strength and performs a significance test on it.
% The measure was introduced first by Goldberg and Brown (1969, J Neurophysiol).
% 
% Vector strength (vs) is computed as follows:
% vs = sqrt ( sum(sin(phi))^2 + sum(cos(phi))^2 ) / n
% where n is the total number of spikes and
% phi = 2*pi*(t/T)
% where t is the time between cycle onset and an evoked spike, and T is the period of the stimulus frequency
% (e.g. the duration of a single sine wave). phi thus represents the phase of the spike in radians.
% 
% The measure has been used many times before, e.g. by Gao and Wehr (Neuron, 2015).
% Note that the definition of vector strength given in Khatri et al. (2004, J Neurophysiol) is incorrect.
% Further information can be found in Grün & Rotter (2010): Analysis of parallel spike trains, Chapter 4,
% written by Ashida, Wagner, and Carr: Processing of phase-locked spikes and periodic signals.

% INPUT
% tspx  a vector of spike timestamps relative to cycle onset in ms
% T     period length of the sine wave in ms
% 
% OUTPUT
% vs    vector strength, a number between 0 and 1
% pvs   the p-value from the Rayleigh test
% 
% HISTORY
% one could add optional bootstrapping the p-value for small sample sizes, see book by Grün & Rotter
