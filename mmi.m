% function [MI,cMI1995,cMI1996] = mmi(s1,s2)
% Computes Shannon's mutual information uncorrected (MI) and corrected (cMI) between two spike count distributions from a single neuron.
% s1 and s2 must be vectors of integers (spikes per trial).
% 
% The formula is (according to Arabzadeh et al., J Neurosci 2007):
% MI = sum over r,s: P(r)*P(s|r)*log2(P(s|r)/P(s)
% 
% This is the formula according to Reyes-Puerta et al., PLoS Comp Biol 2014 (also see Panzeri & Treves, Network 1996):
% MI = H(R) - H(R|S) = sum over s: P(s) * sum over r: P(r|s)*log2(P(r|s)/P(r))
% H(R) is the response entropy (overall variability of the responses) and H(R|S) is the noise entropy (response variability to a given stimulus).
% 
% This is the formula in Treves and Panzeri, Neural Computation 1995:
% MI = sum over s: P(s) * sum over r: P(r|s)*log2(P(r|s)) - P(r)*log2(P(r))
% 
% Let's assume the following spike count distributions for a single neuron and two stimuli:
% s1 = [0,0,1,2,2,3,5]
% s2 = [0,0,1,2,3,4,4]
% P(r=3) = 2/14
% P(s=s1) = P(s=s2) = 7/14;
% P(s=s1|r=3) = 1/2
% 
% An apparent problem is that log2(0) yields negative infinity; this is unavoidable because either P(r|s) or P(s|r) will be 0 for
% some value of r in almost any data set! But I think one can ignore this - responses which do not occur are simply not used.
% Another issue is that the maximum information is determined by the probabilities of the two stimuli; if they are equal, max(I)=1.
% If they are unequal, max(I) is smaller: max(I) = H(S) (Borst & Theunissen, Nat Neurosci 1999).
% H(S) = -sum over s: P(s)*log2(Ps)
% For two equiprobable stimuli Ps1=0.5,Ps2=1-Ps1, H(S) = -sum([Ps1*log2(Ps1),Ps2*log2(Ps2)]) = 1.
% Ps1=1/6 and Ps2=1-Ps1, H(S) = 0.650
% Ps1=1/4 and Ps2=1-Ps1, H(S) = 0.811 
% Ps1=1/3 and Ps2=1-Ps1, H(S) = 0.918
% Ps1=6/10 and Ps2=1-Ps1, H(S) = 0.971
% Ps1=18/38 and Ps2=1-Ps1, H(S) = 0.998
% Thus, as long as we stay reasonable close to 50%, we end up in a regime where max(I) is close 1.
% We could temper this even further if we subsample and bootstrap when we stray too far from stimulus equiprobability.
% 
% The first output (MI) was confirmed through "information.m" from the Information Breakdown Toolbox.
% The second and third outputs match up with what they write in the 1996 and 2007 papers, they are however not identical to the output of the ITB.
% This is most probably because the effective number of responses Rs is estimated, not taken naively (see Panzeri 2007, p. 5). Since cMI1996 is higher
% than cMI1995, I advise to use the latter.

%% bias correction
% I computed three different types of bias correction according to formulas presented in Panzeri's 1995, 1996, and 2007 papers.
% The 1996 and 2007 factors yielded equal results.
% The 1995 factor is always higher but is an overestimation when Rs<R. See below for details
% 
% Treves and Panzeri, Neural Computation 1995: C = (1/(2N*ln(2))) * (S-1) * (R-1)
C1995 = (1/(2*numel(s1s2)*log(2))) * (2-1) * (sum(ns1s2~=0)-1);
% The first part is getting smaller with increasing N: for N=20, it is 0.036, for N=100, it is 0.007 (i.e., a fifth).
% The second part increases with S and R (S is the number of stimuli, R is the number of response bins).
% I am quite sure that I implemented this correctly.
% They however go on to say that this correction factor is too large, and a better one is:
% C = (1/(2*numel(s1s2)*log(2))) * (S-1)*(R'-1), where R' is an "effective" number of response bins.
% This however seems to apply for data which has been "regularized" in some way, and I would not know how to arrive at this for my data.
% 
% In the 1996 paper, they say that the C1995 measure is appropriate only when each response bin has a non-zero probability of being occupied 
% for every stimulus - this is rarely the case for us.
% So one should perhaps use the following expression from Panzeri and Treves, Network 1996:
% C = 1/(2N*log(2)) * ((sum over s: Rs) - R - (S-1))
C1996 = (1/(2*numel(s1s2)*log(2))) * (sum(ns1~=0) + sum(ns2~=0) - sum(ns1s2~=0)-(2-1));
% For Rs, we can simply take the number of relevant responses for the neuron, or one can estimate it with a Bayesian procedure (see the paper).
% If we do the former (the "naive count" - Ince et al., 2014), we are likely to underestimate Rs because of limited sampling.
% Not sure whether this is relevant for us anyway, because they mention it is important after regularization.
% Strange - the second term will always be negative!!!
% I am unsure whether I correctly grasped the meaning of the curly brackets in this context.
% In any case, C1996 gives weird results for small (but not very large) sample sizes.
% 
% The formula again looks different in Panzeri et al., J Neurophysiol 2007, equation 4:
% C = 1/(2N*log(2)) * (sum over s:(Rs-1)) - (R-1))
% C2007 = (1/(2*numel(s1s2)*log(2))) * ((sum(ns1~=0)-1)+(sum(ns2~=0)-1)-(sum(ns1s2~=0)-1));
% C2007 gives similarly weird results for small sample sizes.
